# CS 438 Communication Networks  
## MP1 (Application layer)
This machine problem introduces you to a bare-bones HTTP client that can get
data from any web server. This is the kind of code that is running in your browser.
You will also create a HTTP server that can serve data to other clients much like
how a real server would function.
## MP2 (Transport layer)
This machine problem tests your understanding of reliable packet transfer. You
will use UDP to implement your own version of TCP. Your implementation must be
able to tolerate packet drops, allow other concurrent connections a fair chance, and
must not be overly nice to other connections (should not give up the entire bandwidth
to other connections).
## MP3 (Network layer)
This machine problem tests your understanding of the distance vector and the
link state routing algorithms. In this MP, you will implement the link state and distance vector routing protocols. You
will write two separate programs: one that implements the link state protocol, and one that
implements the distance vector protocol. Both programs will read the same file formats to get
the networkâ€™s topology and what messages to send.
## MP4 (Link layer)
This machine problem tests your understanding of the random backoff and medium access in a
wired network. In this assignment, you will develop a toy simulator that evaluates the performance of simplified
CSMA protocols in a wired network.
